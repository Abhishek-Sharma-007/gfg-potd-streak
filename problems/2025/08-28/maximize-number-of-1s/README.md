# maximize /number /of /1s
# Maximize Number of 1's

Given a binary array `arr[]` and integer `k`, flip at most `k` zeroes to 1 to
maximize the length of a consecutive-1s subarray.

**Key idea (sliding window, O(n)):**  
Expand a window with `right`, count zeros. If zeros exceed `k`, shrink from
`left` until theyâ€™re `<= k`. Track the best window size.

- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(1)`
