# 2025-09-06 - Find length of Loop

Problem: Detect if a linked list has a loop and return its length; else return 0.

Approach: Floyd's cycle detection to find a meeting point, then iterate around the cycle once to count nodes.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README and updated index.
