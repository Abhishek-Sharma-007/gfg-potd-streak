# 2025-08-28 — Maximize Number of 1's

## Problem
Given a binary array `arr[]` of 0s and 1s and an integer `k`, you can flip at most `k` zeros to ones. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1’s possible.

## Approach
- Use the **sliding window** technique.
- Keep a window `[left..right]` with at most `k` zeros.
- Expand `right`, and when zeros exceed `k`, move `left` forward.
- Track the maximum window length as the answer.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(1)

## Status
✅ Implemented solutions in Python, Java, JavaScript.  
✅ Added to repo index and tested.
