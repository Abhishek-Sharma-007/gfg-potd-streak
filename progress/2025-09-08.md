# 2025-09-08 - Merge Sort for Linked List

Problem: Sort a singly linked list using merge sort.

Approach: Split by slow/fast to find mid, cut the list, recursively sort halves, and merge two sorted lists. In-place pointer manipulation, no array conversion.

Complexity: O(n log n) time, O(log n) recursion depth.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README and updated index.
