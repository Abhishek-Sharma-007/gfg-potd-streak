# 2025-09-02 - Swap Kth nodes from ends

Problem: Given a singly linked list and integer k, swap the k-th node from start and k-th from end (1-based). If k > n, return original list.

Approach: Two-pass pointer swap.
- Pass 1: compute n. If k > n or nodes are same (k == n-k+1), return head.
- Pass 2: locate (prev1, node1) at i1 = k and (prev2, node2) at i2 = n-k+1. Ensure i1 < i2 for simpler rewiring.
- Rewire prev pointers, then swap node1.next and node2.next.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

Status: Implemented in Python, JavaScript, and Java. Added problem README and updated root index.
