# 2025-09-09 - Assign Mice Holes

Problem: Assign each mouse to a unique hole to minimize the maximum arrival time.

Approach: Sort mice and holes arrays and pair by index; answer is max |mices[i] - holes[i]|.

Complexity: O(n log n) time, O(1) extra space.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README and updated index.
