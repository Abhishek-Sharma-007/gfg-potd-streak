# 2025-09-05 - Segregate Even and Odd Nodes

Problem: Rearrange a singly linked list so that even-valued nodes appear before odd-valued nodes while preserving original relative order within each group.

Approach: Stable partition using two chains (even, odd) built in a single pass, then link even tail to odd head.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) extra space.

Status: Implemented solutions in Python, JavaScript, and Java; added README and updated root index.
