# 2025-08-29 - Smallest window containing all characters

Problem: Given strings s and p, find the smallest substring of s that contains all characters of p (with multiplicities). Return empty string if none.

Approach: Sliding window with frequency counts. Expand right; when all required character counts are met, shrink left to minimize while valid. Track best window.

Status: Implemented Python, Java, JavaScript solutions and problem README.
