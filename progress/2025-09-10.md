# 2025-09-10 - Largest number in one swap

Problem: Given a numeric string, make it lexicographically largest by swapping at most one pair of digits.

Approach: Precompute rightmost maximum digit index for each suffix. Scan from left; at first index where suffix max > current, swap with that rightmost max and return. If none, string is already optimal.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space (can be optimized to O(1) extra with careful scanning).

Status: Implemented Java, Python, and JavaScript solutions; added README and updated index.
