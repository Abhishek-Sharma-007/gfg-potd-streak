# 2025-09-01 - Sum of Mode

Problem: Given `arr[]` and window size `k`, compute the sum of modes across all contiguous subarrays of size `k`. Mode is by highest frequency, tie-broken by smallest value.

Approach: Sliding window with frequency map. Retrieve the current mode in O(log k) using an ordered structure:
- Java: `TreeSet` keyed by `(-freq, value)`.
- Python/JS: min-heap of `(-freq, value)` with lazy deletion to stay consistent with `cnt`.

Complexity: O(n log k) time, O(k) space.

Status: Implemented Python, Java, and JavaScript solutions and updated readme index.
