# 2025-09-03 - Reverse a Doubly Linked List

Problem: Given the head of a doubly linked list, reverse it and return the new head.

Approach: Iterate and swap `prev` and `next` for each node; move to `curr.prev` (originally next). After traversal, set new head as `temp.prev` if `temp` is not null.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README with explanation; updated root index.
