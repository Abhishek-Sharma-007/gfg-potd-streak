# 2025-09-07 - Merge K Sorted Linked Lists

Problem: Merge an array of k sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.

Approach: Min-heap over current heads of each list. Pop smallest, append to result, push its next if present. Alternatively, divide-and-conquer pairwise merge.

Complexity: O(N log k) time, O(k) space.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README and updated index.
