# 2025-09-04 - Linked List Group Reverse

Problem: Reverse every k nodes in a singly linked list. If the last group has fewer than k nodes, still reverse it.

Approach: Iterative in-place reversal per group using a dummy head, relinking `prevTail` to the new group head and connecting the group's tail to the next head. Always reverse the remaining nodes (no skipping the short final group).

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README and updated root index.
