# 2025-09-11 - Minimum Jumps

Problem: Given arr[i] as max forward steps from i, find minimum jumps to reach the end (or -1 if unreachable).

Approach: Greedy window expansion â€” track `end` (current layer boundary) and `farthest` reach. As we scan, update `farthest`; when we hit `end`, increment jumps and set `end=farthest`. If ever `i>farthest`, return -1. Early return when `end>=n-1`.

Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space.

Status: Implemented Python, JavaScript, and Java solutions; added README with concepts and language notes; updated root index.
